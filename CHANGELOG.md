# Changelog

## 2.3.0

- `tailspin` now reads lines in chunks and highlights them in parallel. This should improve performance especially when
  reading large files.
- Changed `-t,--tail` flag to `-e,--start-at-end` to avoid confusion with `tail -f`

## 2.2.0

- Added flags for setting simple highlights on the fly, for example: (`tspin --words-red popcorn,movie`)
- Properly flatten and merge keywords to improve regex performance
- Binaries are now added to the GitHub Release (Thanks @ecarrara and @supleed2)
- Added `HEAD` HTTP method to the REST keywords (Thanks @mkogan1)
- Fixed a bug where the message `Failed to open file with less: Exit code 0` would show after exiting `less`

## 2.1.0

- Fixed a bug where opening empty files would hang forever
- Look for config file in `USERPROFILE` and `$HOME` instead of just `$HOME`
- Added flags for disabling builtin keywords
- Process names with dashes are now highlighted properly
- Better error messages when `less` is not found

## 2.0.0

- Changed the binary name from `spin` to `tspin`

This is a symbolic release to settle on a new binary name with fewer conflicts. Both `tailspin` and `spin` already exist
as binaries in different systems and distributions. `tspin` is a short and unique name that is unlikely to conflict with
other binaries.

- Fixed a bug where the `--print` flag would occasionally cause a panic

## 1.6.0

- Improved output when trying to open a file or folder which doesn't exist

## 1.3.0 - 31.07.23

- Added support for tailing folders
- Changed behavior: `tailspin` will now print to `stdout` by default if used in a pipe. For
  example: `echo "hello null" | spin`
  will output a syntax highlighted "hello null" directly to `stdout` instead of via the pager less. The change will make
  it easier to use tailspin in scripting and piping.
