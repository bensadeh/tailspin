## 5.0.0

This is a relatively small update with one breaking change, namely the removal of the ability to watch folders. It's
never fun to remove features from `tailspin` that users enjoy and use, however as the tool grows, it has become more
important for me to focus on the core functionality of `tailspin` which is highlighting.

I hope that I've made `tailspin` modular and extensible so that user are able to script and extend `tailspin` to
alleviate this change.

On a lighter note, I've added support for custom pagers. This means that you can now use `tailspin` with your favorite
pager, for example `ov` or `minus`.

### New features:

- Added support for using custom pagers

### Bugfixes:

- Fixed a bug in the config parser where it would fall back on looking for the theme in `~/tailspin/theme.toml`
  instead of `~/.config/tailspin/theme.toml` if `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset
- Fixed a bug where `tailspin` would crash reading files with one line

### Under the hood:

- Use `PathBuf` instead of String for file paths
- Updated shell completion commands names
- Added `miette` for prettier error messages
- Removed unnecessary use of `Box`
- Bump Rust edition to 2024

### Breaking changes:

- Removed support for watching folders

## 4.0.0

### Overview

This release contains several new feature and breaking changes. From a user perspective, the most notable change is the
addition of a `JSON` highlighter. From a developer's perspective, the highlighting engine powering `tailspin` has been
decoupled and extracted into a separate library called [`manifold`](https://github.com/bensadeh/manifold).

`manifold` will still be used internally by `tailspin`, but it will also be available as a standalone library for other
projects to use.

### New features:

- Added support for handling lines which are valid `JSON`. `tailspin` will recognize if the line is a valid JSON object
  and highlight it accordingly.
- Added date and time highlighter for formats like `DD/MM/YYYY`

### Breaking changes:

- `tailspin` will now look for `theme.toml` instead of `config.toml` for the configuration file
- Enabling and disabling highlight groups is now done from the command line instead of in the toml file
- Removed the `border` from the style from the keyword styling. Instead, the border will be enabled implicitly by
  setting a background color for the keyword.
- Removed date highlighting for formats like `Aug 14` and `Sun Dec 14` etc. (Can be re-enabled by adding a custom
  regex highlighter)
- One highlighting group for both date and time

## 3.0.2

- Add completion hint so shells understand they can complete with file names (Thanks @alerque !)

## 3.0.1

- Improve parsing of very large log files

## 3.0.0

### Overview

In November 2023, `tailspin` had 240 stars and was only available to downloads on Crates.io and Debian. At the time of
writing this, it sits at over 4k stars and is available on most major Linux distributions, macOS and Windows.

I am glad to see that `tailspin` has been useful to so many people.

For version `3.0.0` there are both new features and breaking changes.

### New features:

- `UUID` highlighter now highlights numbers and letters in individual styling
- Process highlighter has updated default styling and matches processes with parenthesis
- Added a new highlighter 32-bit and 64-bit pointers (e.g. `0x7f8c8c0c0c0c`)
- Added a `IPv6` highlighter (e.g. `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`)
- Dates formatted as `yyyy/mm/dd` and `Day Month DD` are now highlighted

### Breaking changes:

##### Renamed `--follow-command` to `--listen-command`

The `--follow-command` flag has been renamed to `--listen-command` to avoid confusion with the `--tail` flag.

##### Removed `--bucket-size` flag

The `--bucket-size` flag has been removed. The bucket size was ultimately an implementation detail that should be set
by the program itself.

##### Removed `shorten-to` flag option for dates and times

The `shorten-to` option for dates and times has been removed. The option, set in `config.toml`, let the user shorten the
date and time to a configurable token.

In order to keep up with the growth of `tailspin`, I've decided to focus on the core of what `tailspin` is doing, namely
highlighting. This meant that I had to remove some features that were not directly related to highlighting.

Apologizes for removing this feature and to those who are using it.

## 2.4.0

- Added a regexp highlighter with support for one capture group
- Changed the behavior of processing lines from `stdin` to be sequential for better stability

## 2.3.0

- `tailspin` now uses multiple threads to process lines in parallel
- Added `--bucket-size` flag to configure the number of lines to process in parallel
- Changed `-t,--tail` flag to `-e,--start-at-end` to avoid confusion with `tail -f`

## 2.2.0

- Added flags for setting simple highlights on the fly, for example: (`tspin --words-red popcorn,movie`)
- Properly flatten and merge keywords to improve regex performance
- Binaries are now added to the GitHub Release (Thanks @ecarrara and @supleed2)
- Added `HEAD` HTTP method to the REST keywords (Thanks @mkogan1)
- Fixed a bug where the message `Failed to open file with less: Exit code 0` would show after exiting `less`

## 2.1.0

- Fixed a bug where opening empty files would hang forever
- Look for config file in `USERPROFILE` and `$HOME` instead of just `$HOME`
- Added flags for disabling builtin keywords
- Process names with dashes are now highlighted properly
- Better error messages when `less` is not found

## 2.0.0

- Changed the binary name from `spin` to `tspin`

This is a symbolic release to settle on a new binary name with fewer conflicts. Both `tailspin` and `spin` already exist
as binaries in different systems and distributions. `tspin` is a short and unique name that is unlikely to conflict with
other binaries.

## 1.6.1

- Fixed a bug where the `--print` flag would occasionally cause a panic

## 1.6.0

- Added new highlight group under Keywords highlighter: HTTP methods
- Added option for adding a border to keywords highlighter
- Disable highlights with `disable` for all highlight groups except Keywords
- Simplified the configuration file format
- Date and time can be configured to be hidden

## 1.5.1

- Update man pages

## 1.5.0 - 16.09.23

- Errors are now printed to `stderr` instead of `stdout`

## 1.4.0 - 12.08.23

- Added `-t`/`--tail` flag to start reading from the end of a file.

- Improved initial output when watching folders
- Improved output when trying to open a file or folder which doesn't exist

## 1.3.0 - 31.07.23

- Added support for tailing folders
- Changed behavior: `tailspin` will now print to `stdout` by default if used in a pipe. For
  example: `echo "hello null" | spin`
  will output a syntax highlighted "hello null" directly to `stdout` instead of via the pager less. The change will make
  it easier to use tailspin in scripting and piping.
- The `--tail-command` flag has been renamed to `--follow-command`

## 1.2.1 - 26.07.23
